            When working on password protection, I was originally going to make the website have a password, and a header which said the password 
            directly below. Not very secure, I know. The user could disable javasript and get right by even if the page hadn't loaded in the background. 
            But for my purposes, it was alright. Then I realized that a site with paid videos would need much more security, and if I added that layer of
            security on my page, any potential companies would not be able to get in. So I started to think of something fun I could add to a section that 
            had its own password, showing off the security. This is what I came up with.

            I recently reached Diamond in Valorant ranked. This is before Ascendent was added, so I didn't get pulled up too much from that. I placed 
            iron in the beta, and it took me almost 5 acts to get here. Here are some clips from my journey up!

            I dont play Sage a lot. That game my teammates wanted to play agent roulette and it got chosen for me. I'm personally more of an initiator. Here's more of 
            my playstyle.
