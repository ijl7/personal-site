            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Isaac Lieber and I am a fourth year Computer Science student at The Ohio State University.
                I plan to graduate in the spring of 2023 with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science Engineering and minors in Business and Game Design. I chose these minors 
                because I felt that many of these courses aligned with my goals in my studies, and eventually can help me in the workforce.
            </p> 
            <p>
                In the header above, you can see me with one of my dogs. Don't worry! I am in the passenger seat. Her name is Maple, and she loves to stick her head out of the window.
                Her and Bear, her older brother, are both Shihpoos. My family is from Solon, Ohio (near Cleveland) - my mom, dad, and 2 younger twin sisters. Many of my other
                family and friends are from Solon as well, and most of my friends actually go to OSU with me. You should be able to click on the image to switch through and see more.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main reason why I love to code is that I really enjoy problem-solving and logic puzzles. When I code, I see an issue to solve and 
                it's fun for me to look at the big picture and see the best way that I can complete the problem. I also have enjoyed working on different types of coding; my classes
                are primarily back-end while this website is more of the front-end, and I would be interested in working in either of these areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy playing video games (Valorant and Fortnite most often) and board games with friends. Sports are also a big part of my life. 
                I played soccer for my 4 years in high school and have continued that passion by joining intramural soccer here at OSU. I additionally enjoy watching almost any sporting event 
                and rooting for Cleveland teams. I love attending Buckeye events as well, especially football games, where I have sat in our student section, Block O, for my 4 years in school.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also enjoy working in the film industry, as two of my friends have a 
                <a href="https://www.doubletakevideo.com/" target="_blank">video production company.</a>
                I have helped them a fair amount both on the production side, as well as by being an actor in some of their own short films, as you can see 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JakeChadFilms" target="_blank">here.</a>
                I was an actor in my high school drama club and, as Cleveland is growing in the film industry, also worked in the summer of 2021 as an extra.
                You might see me in the Netflix movie <i>White Noise</i>, coming out in the fall of 2022.

        <div id="siteInfo" class="section">
            <h3>Site Info</h3>
            <p>
                This site was primarily built as a passion project, in order to hone my skills and also show expansion into new areas, since as previously mentioned, many school projects 
                are more focused on back-end technology. However, this website was not simply built as resume padding. It further allowed me to see how managing my time on a project would work, 
                and also allowed for building of my creativity and problem solving, as I attempted to incorporate features that are both aesthetically pleasing and useful. 
                Building this site also involved a fair amount of research, not only into new coding languages, but how to purchase a domain and manage
                the site as well. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When I began building my site, I quickly realized that on one service, all I would be allowed to do was to build a static site. That may be sufficient for 
                a site like this that holds a portfolio, but I wanted to do more. I had to install new tools and go to a new provider in order to make the site dynamic.
                I felt as if this was a necessary part of my development in web programming, since many sites nowadays use dynamic sites in order to customize things 
                like ads based on who is visiting the site.
            </p>
            <p>
                I then purchased a domain name and generated a CNAME record for my newly purchased domain on the service. This is logged to ensure that I own the domain.
                Finally, I took extra steps to make sure my website was secure. I generated a SSL certificate to make sure that all traffic was protected from attacks.
                This Transport Layer Security allows for peace of mind when browsing through my site, even though I may not be peddling any goods besides my hard work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, you might be wondering why the site has a password-protected section. The idea for this began when my friends (the Double Take Video ones) told me that I could help them 
                coding a website for online purchases. After filming the Streetsboro Bicentennial, citizens were allowed to purchase a video, with one option being for a digital 
                copy. Building my website first allowed me to focus on some things that might be necessary for a site where clients can enter their code and get the video. 
                In this case, I used my clips from Valorant, and I opened a viewer instead of a download link. The username is admin and the password is password.

            <h3>Projects</h3>
            <p>
                Throughout my first two years in school, many of my projects were through FastX, and therefore do not appear on Github. As we built up our git skills, 
                we eventually made the transition. However, even though many of my projects on GitHub have been for school, they are necessarily private (for plagiarism purposes).
                The contributions on my page to private projects are still visible, and descriptions and images of these projects will be shared below. 
                Projects will be listed from newest to oldest, once I get around to adding 3 years of schoolwork to the end of this site.
