            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Isaac Lieber and I am a fourth year Computer Science student at The Ohio State University.
                I plan to graduate in the spring of 2023 with a B.S. CSE and minors in Buisness and Game Design. I chose these minors because I felt that
                many of these courses alligned with my goals in my studies, and eventually can help me in the workforce.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main reason why I love to code is that I really enjoy problem-solving and logic puzzles. When I code, I see an issue to solve and 
                it's fun for me to look at the big picture and see the best way that I can complete the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy playing video games (Valorant and Fortnite most often) and board games with friends. Sports are also a big part of my life. 
                I played soccer for my 4 years in high school and have continued that passion by joining intramural soccer here at OSU. I also enjoy watching almost any sporting event 
                and rooting for Cleveland teams. I love attending Buckeye events as well, especially football games, where I have sat in our student section, Block O, for my 4 years in school.
