            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Isaac Lieber and I am a fourth year Computer Science student at The Ohio State University.
                I plan to graduate in the spring of 2023 with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science Engineering and minors in Business and Game Design. I chose these minors because 
                I felt that many of these courses alligned with my goals in my studies, and eventually can help me in the workforce.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main reason why I love to code is that I really enjoy problem-solving and logic puzzles. When I code, I see an issue to solve and 
                it's fun for me to look at the big picture and see the best way that I can complete the problem. I also have enjoyed working on different types of coding; my classes
                are primarily back-end while this website is more of the front-end, and I would be interested in working in either of these areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy playing video games (Valorant and Fortnite most often) and board games with friends. Sports are also a big part of my life. 
                I played soccer for my 4 years in high school and have continued that passion by joining intramural soccer here at OSU. I additionally enjoy watching almost any sporting event 
                and rooting for Cleveland teams. I love attending Buckeye events as well, especially football games, where I have sat in our student section, Block O, for my 4 years in school.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also enjoy working in the film industry, as two of my friends have a 
                <a href="https://www.doubletakevideo.com/" target="_blank">video production company.</a>
                I have helped them a fair amount both on the production side, as well as by being an actor in some of their own short films, as you can see 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JakeChadFilms" target="_blank">here.</a>
                I was an actor in my high school drama club and, as Cleveland is growing in the film industry, also worked in the summer of 2021 as an extra.
                You might see me in the Netflix movie <i>White Noise</i>, coming out in the fall of 2022.

            <h3>Site Info</h3>
            <p>
                This site was primarily built as a passion project, in order to hone my skills and also show expansion into new areas, since as previously mentioned, many school projects 
                are more focused on back-end technology. Building this site involved a fair amount of research, not only into new coding languages, but how to purchase a domain and manage
                the site as well. 
            </p>
            <p>
                However, this website was not simply built as resume padding. It further allowed me to see how managing my time on a project would work, and also allowed 
                for building of my creativity and problem solving, as I attempted to incorporate features that are both aesthetically pleasing and useful.

            <h3>Projects</h3>
            <p>
                Throughout my first two years in school, many of my projects were through FastX, and not on Github. As we built up out git skills, we eventually made the transition.
                Although many of my projects on GitHub have been for school, they are necessarily private (for plagiarism purposes). The contributions on my page 
                to private projects are still visible, and descriptions and images of these projects will be shared below. Projects will be listed from newest to oldest.
